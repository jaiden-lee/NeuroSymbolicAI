            "answer": "MT-Bench is a challenging multi-turn benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to engage in coherent, informative, and engaging conversations. It consists of a series of open-ended questions that assess chatbots' multi-turn conversational and instruction-following abilities, which are critical elements for understanding human preferences."

            "question": "How does MTBench differ from Chatbot Arena?",
            "answer": "MT-Bench focuses on evaluating chatbotsâ€™ multi-turn conversational and instruction-following abilities using open-ended questions. It employs human ratings through pairwise comparison to assess chatbot responses. In contrast, Chatbot Arena features anonymous, randomized battles among large language models (LLMs) and ranks them based on Elo ratings determined by crowdsourced votes. While MT-Bench emphasizes response quality and differentiation, Chatbot Arena provides comparative performance insights through real-world scenario battles."
