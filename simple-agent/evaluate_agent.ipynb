We use two kinds of judges: LLM judges and collected crowd judges (2114 unique IPs)., In this paper, we propose LLM-as-a-judge for chatbot evaluation and systematically examine its efficacy using human preference data from 58 experts on MT-bench, as well as thousands of crowd-users on Chatbot Arena.\n",

On MT-bench, we also study the agreement among humans. MT-bench represents a small-scale study with controlled human evaluation, while Chatbot Arena represents a larger-scale study with crowdsourced human evaluation in the wild., To study this, we introduce two benchmarks with human ratings as the primary evaluation metric: MT-bench and Chatbot Arena.\n",

      "Answer: To enhance an LLM-as-a-judge's grading ability for math and reasoning questions, two methods are proposed - chain-of-thought judge and reference-guided judge. The chain-of-thought method involves prompting an LLM to answer independently first before starting the grading process but may still result in similar mistakes if misled by context during problem-solving. On the other hand, the reference-guided approach uses the generated independent answer as a benchmark for grading, reducing failure rates significantly from 70% to around 15%.

The chain-of-thought method involves prompting an LLM to answer independently first before starting the grading process but may still result in similar mistakes if misled by context during problem-solving. On the other hand, the reference-guided approach uses the generated independent answer as a benchmark for grading, reducing failure rates significantly from 70% to around 15%.

      "MT-bench is a series of open-ended questions that evaluate a chatbot’s multi-turn conversational and instruction-following ability – two critical elements for human preference. MT-bench is also carefully constructed to differentiate chatbots based on their core capabilities, such as reasoning and math.\n",
      "In addition, we develop Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourced platform featuring anonymous battles between chatbots in real-world scenarios – Users engage in conversations with two chatbots at the same time and rate their responses based on personal preferences.]\n"

      "Thought: I now know about MTBench and have been given several insights into its purpose and comparison to other tools like Chatbot Arena.\n",
      "Answer: MTBench is a benchmarking tool used for judging Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically in multi-turn settings, with different judges including both LLMs and expert human labelers. It focuses on evaluating models' abilities over multiple rounds of judgment rather than single answer grading, which allows a better understanding of the model's nuanced capabilities such as reasoning, math skills, and coding competency. The tool has been compared to other similar tools like Chatbot Arena for assessment purposes. In particular, GPT-4 was noted to perform significantly better in most categories when evaluated under MTBench conditions, although there were some limitations observed with its performance in certain areas such as reasoning, math, and coding tasks. The methodology involves human evaluators making judgments on a set of questions posed by the models across various domains.\n",

      "Answer: Based on my research, MTBench primarily focuses on evaluating LLMs' abilities using a multi-turn judging approach involving both model-generated and human responses across various domains like reasoning, math, and coding. The evaluation process involves multiple rounds of judgment to capture nuanced skills, with specific attention paid to the differences in performance between different models such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLM judges, and expert humans. MTBench is described as a smaller scale study that provides controlled human evaluations for comparison.\n",

      "Observation: [Human preference benchmarks such as MT-bench and Chatbot Arena serve as valuable additions to the current standardized LLM benchmarks. They focus on different aspects of a model and the recommended way is to comprehensively evaluate models with both kinds of benchmarks., In this paper, we propose LLM-as-a-judge for chatbot evaluation and systematically examine its efficacy using human preference data from 58 experts on MT-bench, as well as thousands of crowd-users on Chatbot Arena.\n",
      "Our results reveal that strong LLMs can achieve an agreement rate of over 80%, on par with the level of agreement among human experts, establishing a foundation for an LLM-based evaluation framework., We study the agreement between different LLM judges and humans on MT-bench and Chatbot Arena datasets. On MT-bench, we also study the agreement among humans. MT-bench represents a small-scale study with controlled human evaluation, while Chatbot Arena represents a larger-scale study with crowdsourced human evaluation in the wild., Title: Judging LLM-as-a-Judge with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena, To study this, we introduce two benchmarks with human ratings as the primary evaluation metric: MT-bench and Chatbot Arena.\n",
      "MT-bench is a series of open-ended questions that evaluate a chatbot’s multi-turn conversational and instruction-following ability – two critical elements for human preference. MT-bench is also carefully constructed to differentiate chatbots based on their core capabilities, such as reasoning and math.\n",
      "In addition, we develop Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourced platform featuring anonymous battles between chatbots in real-world scenarios – Users engage in conversations with two chatbots at the same time and rate their responses based on personal preferences.]\n"

The win rate curves from LLM judges closely match the curves from humans. On MT-bench second turn, proprietary models like Claude and GPT-3.5 are more preferred by the humans compared to the first turn, meaning that a multi-turn benchmark can better differentiate some advanced abilities of models. We also list the per-category win rate of representative models in Table 8 to show how MT-bench differentiates models, in which we see GPT-4 is significantly better than others.\n",
      "Vicuna-13B is noticeably worse than GPT-3.5/4 in reasoning, math, and coding categories.\n",
      "Note that in math/coding category, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have similar overall win-rate because they both failed to answer some hard questions, but GPT-4 is still significantly better than GPT-3 in the direct pairwise comparison or single-answer grading.\n",
      "Please see a performance breakdown of MT-bench score for each category in Section D.4., MT-bench.\n",
      "We generate answers for all 80 questions with 6 models: GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude-V1, Vicuna-13B, Alpaca-13B [38], and LLaMA-13B [39]. We then use 2 kinds of judges: LLM judges and 58 expert-level human labelers. The labelers are mostly graduate students so they are considered experts and more skilled than average crowd workers.\n",
      "We let LLM judges evaluate all pairs and let each human evaluate at least 20 random multi-turn questions. This resulted in around 3K votes for all questions.\n",
      "The detailed data collection process is in Appendix C., Human preference benchmarks such as MT-bench and Chatbot Arena serve as valuable additions to the current standardized LLM benchmarks. They focus on different aspects of a model and the recommended way is to comprehensively evaluate models with both kinds of benchmarks., We study the agreement between different LLM judges and humans on MT-bench and Chatbot Arena datasets. On MT-bench, we also study the agreement among humans. MT-bench represents a small-scale study with controlled human evaluation, while Chatbot Arena represents a larger-scale study with crowdsourced human evaluation in the wild.]\n",

      "Observation: [In both tables, GPT-4 with single-answer grading matches both pairwise GPT-4 and human preferences very well.\n",
      "This means GPT-4 has a relatively stable internal rubric.\n",
      "Although it may sometimes perform slightly worse than pairwise comparison and give more tie votes, it is a more scalable method., Figure 10 (Appendix) shows an example of position bias.\n",
      "GPT-4 is tasked to evaluate two responses from GPT-3.5 and Vicuna-13B to an open-ended question. When GPT-3.5’s answer is positioned first, GPT-4 considers GPT-3.5’s answer more detailed and superior. However, upon switching the positions of the two responses, GPT-4’s judgement flips, favoring Vicuna’s answer., We then perform a breakdown analysis by computing agreement on different model pairs and categories.\n",
      "We only include non-tied votes.\n",
      "In Table 7, we observe the agreement between GPT-4 and human progressively increases in line with the performance disparity of the model pairs (i.e., larger win rate difference), from 70% to nearly 100%. This suggests that GPT-4 aligns with humans better when significant performance differences exist between the models., We plot the average win rate of models under different judges on MT-bench and Chatbot Arena in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively. The win rate curves from LLM judges closely match the curves from humans. On MT-bench second turn, proprietary models like Claude and GPT-3.5 are more preferred by the humans compared to the first turn, meaning that a multi-turn benchmark can better differentiate some advanced abilities of models.

      "LLMs are known to have limited math and reasoning capability [10], which results in its failure of grading such questions because they do not know the correct answers.\n",
      "However, what is more intriguing is that it also shows limitations in grading basic math problems which it is capable of solving.\n",
      "For instance, in Figure 12 (Appendix), we present an example of an elementary math question in which GPT-4 makes an incorrect judgment.\n",
      "It’s worth noting that although GPT-4 can solve the problem (when asked separately), it was misled by the provided answers, ultimately resulting in incorrect judgment.\n",
      "This pattern can also be seen in a reasoning question example in Figure 13 (Appendix).\n",

The win rate curves from LLM judges closely match the curves from humans. On MT-bench second turn, proprietary models like Claude and GPT-3.5 are more preferred by the humans compared to the first turn, meaning that a multi-turn benchmark can better differentiate some advanced abilities of models. We also list the per-category win rate of representative models in Table 8 to show how MT-bench differentiates models, in which we see GPT-4 is significantly better than others.\n",
      "Vicuna-13B is noticeably worse than GPT-3.5/4 in reasoning, math, and coding categories.\n",

      "Please see a performance breakdown of MT-bench score for each category in Section D.4., MT-bench.\n",
      "We generate answers for all 80 questions with 6 models: GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude-V1, Vicuna-13B, Alpaca-13B [38], and LLaMA-13B [39]. We then use 2 kinds of judges: LLM judges and 58 expert-level human labelers. The labelers are mostly graduate students so they are considered experts and more skilled than average crowd workers.\n",
      "We let LLM judges evaluate all pairs and let each human evaluate at least 20 random multi-turn questions. This resulted in around 3K votes for all questions.\n",
      "The detailed data collection process is in Appendix C., Human preference benchmarks such as MT-bench and Chatbot Arena serve as valuable additions to the current standardized LLM benchmarks. They focus on different aspects of a model and the recommended way is to comprehensively evaluate models with both kinds of benchmarks., We study the agreement between different LLM judges and humans on MT-bench and Chatbot Arena datasets. On MT-bench, we also study the agreement among humans. MT-bench represents a small-scale study with controlled human evaluation, while Chatbot Arena represents a larger-scale study with crowdsourced human evaluation in the wild.]\n",

      "Although it may sometimes perform slightly worse than pairwise comparison and give more tie votes, it is a more scalable method., Figure 10 (Appendix) shows an example of position bias.\n",
      "GPT-4 is tasked to evaluate two responses from GPT-3.5 and Vicuna-13B to an open-ended question. When GPT-3.5’s answer is positioned first, GPT-4 considers GPT-3.5’s answer more detailed and superior. However, upon switching the positions of the two responses, GPT-4’s judgement flips, favoring Vicuna’s answer., We then perform a breakdown analysis by computing agreement on different model pairs and categories.\n",

      "In Table 7, we observe the agreement between GPT-4 and human progressively increases in line with the performance disparity of the model pairs (i.e., larger win rate difference), from 70% to nearly 100%. This suggests that GPT-4 aligns with humans better when significant performance differences exist between the models., We plot the average win rate of models under different judges on MT-bench and Chatbot Arena in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively. The win rate curves from LLM judges closely match the curves from humans. On MT-bench second turn, proprietary models like Claude and GPT-3.5 are more preferred by the humans compared to the first turn, meaning that a multi-turn benchmark can better differentiate some advanced abilities of models.

      "However, what is more intriguing is that it also shows limitations in grading basic math problems which it is capable of solving.\n",
      "For instance, in Figure 12 (Appendix), we present an example of an elementary math question in which GPT-4 makes an incorrect judgment.\n",
      "It’s worth noting that although GPT-4 can solve the problem (when asked separately), it was misled by the provided answers, ultimately resulting in incorrect judgment.\n",

The win rate curves from LLM judges closely match the curves from humans. On MT-bench second turn, proprietary models like Claude and GPT-3.5 are more preferred by the humans compared to the first turn, meaning that a multi-turn benchmark can better differentiate some advanced abilities of models. We also list the per-category win rate of representative models in Table 8 to show how MT-bench differentiates models, in which we see GPT-4 is significantly better than others.\n",
      "Vicuna-13B is noticeably worse than GPT-3.5/4 in reasoning, math, and coding categories.\n",
      "Note that in math/coding category, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have similar overall win-rate because they both failed to answer some hard questions, but GPT-4 is still significantly better than GPT-3 in the direct pairwise comparison or single-answer grading.\n",
      "Please see a performance breakdown of MT-bench score for each category in Section D.4., MT-bench.\n",
      "We generate answers for all 80 questions with 6 models: GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude-V1, Vicuna-13B, Alpaca-13B [38], and LLaMA-13B [39]. We then use 2 kinds of judges: LLM judges and 58 expert-level human labelers. The labelers are mostly graduate students so they are considered experts and more skilled than average crowd workers.\n",
      "We let LLM judges evaluate all pairs and let each human evaluate at least 20 random multi-turn questions. This resulted in around 3K votes for all questions.\n",
      "The detailed data collection process is in Appendix C., Human preference benchmarks such as MT-bench and Chatbot Arena serve as valuable additions to the current standardized LLM benchmarks. They focus on different aspects of a model and the recommended way is to comprehensively evaluate models with both kinds of benchmarks., We study the agreement between different LLM judges and humans on MT-bench and Chatbot Arena datasets. On MT-bench, we also study the agreement among humans. MT-bench represents a small-scale study with controlled human evaluation, while Chatbot Arena represents a larger-scale study with crowdsourced human evaluation in the wild.]\n",

      "Although it may sometimes perform slightly worse than pairwise comparison and give more tie votes, it is a more scalable method., Figure 10 (Appendix) shows an example of position bias.\n",
      "GPT-4 is tasked to evaluate two responses from GPT-3.5 and Vicuna-13B to an open-ended question. When GPT-3.5’s answer is positioned first, GPT-4 considers GPT-3.5’s answer more detailed and superior. However, upon switching the positions of the two responses, GPT-4’s judgement flips, favoring Vicuna’s answer., We then perform a breakdown analysis by computing agreement on different model pairs and categories.\n",

      "In Table 7, we observe the agreement between GPT-4 and human progressively increases in line with the performance disparity of the model pairs (i.e., larger win rate difference), from 70% to nearly 100%. This suggests that GPT-4 aligns with humans better when significant performance differences exist between the models., We plot the average win rate of models under different judges on MT-bench and Chatbot Arena in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively. The win rate curves from LLM judges closely match the curves from humans. On MT-bench second turn, proprietary models like Claude and GPT-3.5 are more preferred by the humans compared to the first turn, meaning that a multi-turn benchmark can better differentiate some advanced abilities of models.

      "However, what is more intriguing is that it also shows limitations in grading basic math problems which it is capable of solving.\n",
      "For instance, in Figure 12 (Appendix), we present an example of an elementary math question in which GPT-4 makes an incorrect judgment.\n",
      "It’s worth noting that although GPT-4 can solve the problem (when asked separately), it was misled by the provided answers, ultimately resulting in incorrect judgment.\n",
      "This pattern can also be seen in a reasoning question example in Figure 13 (Appendix).\n",

The win rate curves from LLM judges closely match the curves from humans. On MT-bench second turn, proprietary models like Claude and GPT-3.5 are more preferred by the humans compared to the first turn, meaning that a multi-turn benchmark can better differentiate some advanced abilities of models. We also list the per-category win rate of representative models in Table 8 to show how MT-bench differentiates models, in which we see GPT-4 is significantly better than others.\n",
      "Vicuna-13B is noticeably worse than GPT-3.5/4 in reasoning, math, and coding categories.\n",
      "Note that in math/coding category, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have similar overall win-rate because they both failed to answer some hard questions, but GPT-4 is still significantly better than GPT-3 in the direct pairwise comparison or single-answer grading.\n",
      "Please see a performance breakdown of MT-bench score for each category in Section D.4., MT-bench.\n",
      "We generate answers for all 80 questions with 6 models: GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude-V1, Vicuna-13B, Alpaca-13B [38], and LLaMA-13B [39]. We then use 2 kinds of judges: LLM judges and 58 expert-level human labelers. The labelers are mostly graduate students so they are considered experts and more skilled than average crowd workers.\n",
      "We let LLM judges evaluate all pairs and let each human evaluate at least 20 random multi-turn questions. This resulted in around 3K votes for all questions.\n",
      "The detailed data collection process is in Appendix C., Human preference benchmarks such as MT-bench and Chatbot Arena serve as valuable additions to the current standardized LLM benchmarks. They focus on different aspects of a model and the recommended way is to comprehensively evaluate models with both kinds of benchmarks., We study the agreement between different LLM judges and humans on MT-bench and Chatbot Arena datasets. On MT-bench, we also study the agreement among humans. MT-bench represents a small-scale study with controlled human evaluation, while Chatbot Arena represents a larger-scale study with crowdsourced human evaluation in the wild.]\n",

      "Observation: [In both tables, GPT-4 with single-answer grading matches both pairwise GPT-4 and human preferences very well.\n",
      "This means GPT-4 has a relatively stable internal rubric.\n",
      "Although it may sometimes perform slightly worse than pairwise comparison and give more tie votes, it is a more scalable method., Figure 10 (Appendix) shows an example of position bias.\n",
      "GPT-4 is tasked to evaluate two responses from GPT-3.5 and Vicuna-13B to an open-ended question. When GPT-3.5’s answer is positioned first, GPT-4 considers GPT-3.5’s answer more detailed and superior. However, upon switching the positions of the two responses, GPT-4’s judgement flips, favoring Vicuna’s answer., We then perform a breakdown analysis by computing agreement on different model pairs and categories.\n",
      "We only include non-tied votes.\n",
      "In Table 7, we observe the agreement between GPT-4 and human progressively increases in line with the performance disparity of the model pairs (i.e., larger win rate difference), from 70% to nearly 100%. This suggests that GPT-4 aligns with humans better when significant performance differences exist between the models., We plot the average win rate of models under different judges on MT-bench and Chatbot Arena in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively. The win rate curves from LLM judges closely match the curves from humans. On MT-bench second turn, proprietary models like Claude and GPT-3.5 are more preferred by the humans compared to the first turn, meaning that a multi-turn benchmark can better differentiate some advanced abilities of models.

      "Please see a performance breakdown of MT-bench score for each category in Section D.4., Limited capability in grading math and reasoning questions.\n",
      "LLMs are known to have limited math and reasoning capability [10], which results in its failure of grading such questions because they do not know the correct answers.\n",
      "However, what is more intriguing is that it also shows limitations in grading basic math problems which it is capable of solving.\n",
      "For instance, in Figure 12 (Appendix), we present an example of an elementary math question in which GPT-4 makes an incorrect judgment.\n",
      "It’s worth noting that although GPT-4 can solve the problem (when asked separately), it was misled by the provided answers, ultimately resulting in incorrect judgment.\n",
      "This pattern can also be seen in a reasoning question example in Figure 13 (Appendix).\n",

MTBench is designed as a controlled benchmarking tool that concentrates specifically on judging Large Language Models (LLMs) through multi-turn interactions with an emphasis on evaluating models' abilities across reasoning, math, coding tasks, using LLM judges along with expert human labelers. The process involves multiple rounds of evaluation to gain comprehensive insight into a model’s capabilities and limitations in diverse scenarios.\\n\\nIn contrast, Chatbot Arena operates as an unconstrained benchmarking platform that evaluates models based on crowdsourced feedback from real-world users.
