MTBench is designed as a controlled benchmarking tool that concentrates specifically on judging Large Language Models (LLMs) through multi-turn interactions with an emphasis on evaluating models' abilities across reasoning, math, coding tasks, using LLM judges along with expert human labelers. The process involves multiple rounds of evaluation to gain comprehensive insight into a modelâ€™s capabilities and limitations in diverse scenarios.\n\nIn contrast, Chatbot Arena operates as an unconstrained benchmarking platform that evaluates models based on crowdsourced feedback from real-world users. The interaction involves direct comparisons among chatbots with various users across different conversation scenarios in natural language understanding: I can evaluate a diverse user preferences between MTBench and Chatbot Arena chatbots, aim to analyze the differences between MTBench Benchmarks\n\n[",
