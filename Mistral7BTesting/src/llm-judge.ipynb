One such method is Simple Moving Average (SMA), where the forecast for a given time period is the average of a certain number of previous periods. Another method is Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), which uses historical data and mathematical formulas to predict future values based on past trends, including seasonality, and can include averages as part of its model.\n",

    "                To answer the question, there are different types of time series forecasting methods that use averages as a basis for their predictions. One such method is Simple Moving Average (SMA), where the forecast for a given time period is the average of a certain number of previous periods.
