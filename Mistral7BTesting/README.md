# Mistral 7B Testing
Most of this code is not production quality, and was mainly used for learning. As a result, it is safe to ignore most of the files in this directory. 

For example, `RAG.py` and `RAG.ipnyb` use langchain to create RAG, which is extremely slow and overly complicated. For an updated version, check out the `rag-pipeline` directory.
